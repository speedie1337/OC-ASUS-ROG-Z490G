# OC-ASUS-ROG-Z490G
My OpenCore configuration for the ASUS ROG Strix Z490-G Gaming (WIFI)

NOTE: I am only making this public because sharing is caring. I have not used macOS in a long time and this config was made for Catalina. For this reason it may no longer work.

I will accept pull requests to fix it up, but please do not file any issues expecting me to fix them.
